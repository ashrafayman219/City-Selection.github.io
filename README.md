# City-Selection.github.io
Here's my latest project using ArcGIS API for JS, which displays a basemap containing data for cities in the world to filter based on their region.

I used new features also in ArcGIS API for JS such as 
#render with Break Values, #esriRequest, #drawCharts from external library such as google charts & charts.js.

Some #widgets such as legend, measurement, and basemap gallery were used.
